This hosts system upgrade automation.

## Prepare the nodes
1. Label masters for k3s server upgrades: `kubectl label nodes <MASTER_NODE> plan.upgrade.cattle.io/k3s-server=enabled`
2. Label workers for k3s agent upgrades: `kubectl label nodes <WORKER_NODE> plan.upgrade.cattle.io/k3s-agent=enabled`
3. Label archlinux nodes (currently all of them): `kubectl label nodes <NODE> plan.upgrade.cattle.io/archlinux=enabled`
4. You need to do that only once in node's lifetime

## Upgrade k3s
1. Email is sent for releases watch on https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s
2. Update version in `system-upgrade/system-upgrade-controller/plans/k3s.yaml`
3. Apply the plan: `kubectl apply -f system-upgrade/system-upgrade-controller/plans/k3s.yaml`

## Upgrade system
1. Update version in `system-upgrade/system-upgrade-controller/plans/archlinux.yaml` to today's date in yyyymmdd format
2. Apply the plan: `kubectl apply -f system-upgrade/system-upgrade-controller/plans/archlinux.yaml`

### Get email with upgrade eligibility
1. SSH to any node
2. Install prerequisites: `sudo pacman -S cronie s-nail`
3. Enable scheduling: `sudo systemctl enable --now cronie`
4. Configure email: `sudo vim /etc/mail.rc`
```
set v15-compat
set from="B.U.V.I.S <postman@iron.buvis.net>"
set mta=smtp://<user>:<password>@email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com:587 \
    smtp-use-starttls
```
4. Create checker script: `sudo vim /usr/local/bin/check-upgrade.sh` from `system-upgrade/system-upgrade-controller/check-upgrade.sh`
5. Make it executable: `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check-upgrade.sh`
6. Schedule it: `sudo crontab -e`:
```
# minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week command
# |      |    |            |     |           |
  0      18   *            *     *           /usr/local/bin/check-upgrade.sh
```

## Troubleshooting
- observe the upgrade: `kubectl get all -n system-upgrade`
- it seems deleting the jobs that are stuck is tolerated by the controller, but being patient (default poll interval is 15 minutes) is preferred
